What is Maven?
  Maven is Project management tool tht is based POM(Page object model).
  It is used for project build, dependency and Documentation.
  It simplifies the build process.

Why Maven was required?
   Maven project eliminates the Adding set of Jars in each project.
   It creates write Project Structure.
   Building and Deploying the project is very Simple.

What is Build Tool?
    A Build tool take care of everything for building a process.It does the following
      Genarates the source code.
      Compliles the source code.
      Packages the compiled code into JAR of ZIP file.
      Installs the package code in local repository,server or central repository.

How to install Maven in windows machine?
     Downlaod  Maven and Extract in machine.
     Add JAVA_HOME and MAVEN_HOME in environment variables.
     Add maven path in evironmental variables.
     verify Maven.

Verify Maven?
     To verify the Maven is installed or not,open the command prompt and write.
       mvn --version

       Maven home:C:\Program Files\apache-maven-3.5.4
       Java home:C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_172

Maven Repository?
        There are 3 types of Maven repository:
         Local Repository
         Central Repository
         Remote Repository

       Maven searches for the dependencies in the following order:
         Local Repository then Central Repository then Remote Repository.

      Local Repository:Means .m2 folder in your system.
      Central Repository:It is located on Web.It has been created by the apache maven community itself.
       Remote Repository:Company specific Libary or custom Library.

Project structure of POM.xml?
   Project, model versions,groupid,artifactId,version,packaging,name ,dependencies etc...
    Project:it is a root elemnt of pom.xml
    model versions:it is sub elemnt of project.it specified modal version .it should be default 4.0.0.
    groupid:it will identify the project unquiely among all projects(com.test.selenium)
    artifactId:project name.
    packaging:it defines packaging such as Jar and War files etc..
    Dependencies:defines the Dependencies of the Project
    Dependency:defines a dependency.it is used inside the Dependencies.
    Scope:defines the scope in the maven project. it is complied,provide,runtime,test and system.
        Project:selenium
                  ->src/main/java
                  ->src/test/java
                  ->JRE system libarary.
                  ->Maven dependencies.
                  ->src
                     ->target
                     ->pom.xml
Maven command:
 mvn clean install
 mvn compile
 mvn test


Maven Life Cycle:
Validate->validate the project is correct and all necessary info is avialable.
complie->it compiles the source code of project.
test->test the compiled source code using suitable unit testing framework.These tests should not required the code be
packed or deployed.
package->take the compile code and package it in distributable format such as Jar etc..
verify-->run any checks on the results of integration of tests to ensure the quality criteria are met.
install->Installs the package code in local repository, for use a dependency in other projects locally.
deploy->done the build env.,copies the final package into local repository for sharing with other develpers and Projects
