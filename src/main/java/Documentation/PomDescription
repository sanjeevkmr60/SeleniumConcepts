POM:
Advantages:
Object Repository
Functional Encapsulation
Low maintenance
Programmer Friendly
Low Redundancy
Efficient & Scalable

Disadvantages
High Setup Time & Effort
Skilled labor
Specific: Not a generic model. Automation Framework developed using POM approach is specific to the application.
          Unlike keyword-driven/data-driven frameworks, it is not a generic framework.




What are the advantages of Page Object Model Framework?
1.Code reusability – We could achieve code reusability by writing the code once and use it in different tests.
2.Code maintainability – There is a clean separation between test code and page
                      specific code such as locators and layout which becomes very easy to maintain code. Code changes
                      only on Page Object Classes when a UI change occurs. It enhances test maintenance and reduces code
                       duplication.

3.Object Repository – Each page will be defined as a java class. All the fields in the page will be defined in an
                    interface as members. The class will then implement the interface.

4.Readability – Improves readability due to clean separation between test code and page specific code

What is POM (Page Object Model)? What are its advantages?
 Page Object Model is a design pattern for creating an Object Repository for web UI elements.
 Each web page in the  application is required to have it’s own corresponding page class.
 The page class is thus responsible for finding the WebElements in that page and then perform operations on those WebElements.

The advantages of using POM are:

Allows us to separate operations and flows in the UI from Verification – improves code readability
Since the Object Repository is independent of Test Cases, multiple tests can use the same Object Repository
Reusability of code
